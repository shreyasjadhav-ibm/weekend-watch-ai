Subject: Code Fix Approval Request - Issue #123 (TypeError: connectorConfig is undefined)

Hi [Developer Name],

This email requests your approval for a code fix.

**Issue:**

The error "TypeError: connectorConfig is undefined" was occurring because the `connectorConfig` object was being used before a `start` method was defined.  The fix adds a `start` method to the `connectorConfig` object.

**Before Code:**

```javascript
const connectorConfig = undefined;
connectorConfig.start(); // Causes TypeError
```

**After Code:**

```javascript
const connectorConfig = { start: () => { console.log('Connector started');} }; //Fixed: Added a start method to the connectorConfig object.
connectorConfig.start();
```
